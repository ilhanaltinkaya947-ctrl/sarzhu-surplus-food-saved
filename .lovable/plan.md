# Fix Multiple Core Features ✅ COMPLETED

All issues have been fixed:

1. ✅ **Basket System Connected** - BasketDrawer now renders in MapPage, basket button opens drawer with item count badge
2. ✅ **Database Schema Updated** - Added `address` and `category` columns to `shops` table
3. ✅ **MarketplaceContext Fixed** - `addShop` and `updateShop` now include address/category fields
4. ✅ **Add Location Button Moved** - Now only appears in Profile tab, removed from header
5. ✅ **RLS Error Fixed** - Merchant dashboard now only shows user-owned shops (no fallback to other shops)
